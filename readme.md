# React 18 package for amazon chime sdk

As this implementation don't exist I am looking to learn more about React and make my own implementation of chime inside React. 

This will take inspiration from the [react 17 project](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-component-library-react)

The idea is to keep simple and not create too much abstraction
