# Approach on working on this project

## Status

<!-- What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.? -->

proposed - work in progress

## Context

<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
How this project is going to handle problems, bugs, features ?

## Decision

<!-- What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing? -->
Generally speaking I prefer to have clear and understable code rather than shorter code possible. I like to think simple first and go incremental on a resolution.

Also following this mindset of the 3M:
- Make it works
- Make it good
- Make it optimized

### Make it work

Here it's something that works easy to read but can be dirty.

### Make it good

If I didn't implement something with tests its here when I will add test, refactor code, add documentation, fixing bugs.

### Make it optimized

For optimization at this point will be generally after having discussion with other devs opinion. As we don't all have the same vision of what is optimized.

But one thing is I will always value something that is clear more than something that is optimized if it impact the DX (developer experience)

## Consequences

<!-- What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change? -->

You may found frustrating some part of the code here as there will be not much one liner code or abstration of abstration.
